# cflow-01

Practice programming with C. This small program shows and practice the usage of C variables, user input and output using `printf` and `scanf` and the control structure `while loop`.

## Program Information

This is a program for calculating water depth in a open channel flow for rectangular section channel. The inputs are:

`discharge` - The flow rate in `m^3/s`  
`n_manning` - n. The Manning's roughness coefficient  
`channel_slope` - The slope of the channel bed in `m/m`  
`base_width` - The width of the channel in `meters`

The output is the computed `water_depth` or the depth of the water in the channel in `meters`.

# Comparison between C and Python

To compare the 2 languages for performance, use the file `flow_python.py` for python, just run it using python 3 version. For the
C counterpart, compile and run the code `flow_c.c`.
